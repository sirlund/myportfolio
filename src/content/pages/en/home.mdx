I'm Nicolás, a product designer with over **15 years of experience**, specializing in Design Systems architecture and DesignOps. I help teams identify opportunities and structure efficient flows, leveraging AI tools to automate the gap between design and execution.

Off-screen, I apply the same rigor to my hobbies as I do to my design systems. I'm a road cycling nerd 🚴 obsessed with race tactics, watts/kg, and keeping my drivetrain silent and waxed. At home, my baby son Gael 👶 is actively reminding me that I had forgotten everything about raising humans. He shares the fort with four cats 🐱 and a house full of plants 🌿.
