## Overview

**12+ digital services. 300 years of heritage. One unified design language.**

Nacional Monte de Piedad is Mexico's oldest financial institution—a 300-year-old nonprofit that serves millions through pawn services, auctions, and financial products. When I joined as Design Systems Lead, their digital transformation was fragmented: web, mobile apps, internal tools, and kiosks all spoke different visual languages.

Over 14 months, I architected a design system that unified this ecosystem while respecting the institution's heritage. The challenge was bridging the gap between a centuries-old brand identity and the demands of modern digital experiences—all while aligning dispersed teams across multiple product lines.
