## Overview

**From single MVP to 7 insurance products—all sharing one design foundation.**

Klare is a Chilean insurtech disrupting traditional insurance with a digital-first approach. When I joined, the company had a single life insurance MVP. Over 2 years, I led the design system evolution that enabled rapid expansion into auto, home, travel, pet, health, and accident insurance—without fragmenting the user experience.

The challenge wasn't just scaling visually—it was creating a flexible system that could handle vastly different insurance flows while maintaining the simplicity that made Klare's MVP successful.
