## Overview

**Parallel native development. Zero design drift. Critical financial flows standardized.**

Wenia is a DeFi platform offering a native crypto-wallet for buying, selling, and managing digital assets. When I joined, the product was building simultaneously for Android and iOS with separate engineering teams—a recipe for design fragmentation in a space where trust depends on visual consistency.

Over 18 months, I established the DesignOps foundation that enabled parallel development without drift. This meant creating platform-aware components, defining critical financial flows (COPW—Crypto Onboarding, Purchase, Withdrawal), and bridging the communication gap between Design and Mobile Engineering.
