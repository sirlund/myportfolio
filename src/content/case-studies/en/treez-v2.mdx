## Overview

**82% less duplication. 30% fewer QA tickets. Designer onboarding cut from 3 weeks to 1.**

Treez is the mission-critical OS for enterprise cannabis retail. When I joined as Design System Lead, rapid growth had created a "re-invention tax"—teams rebuilt the same UI every sprint with different quality. The lack of unified design language was blocking mobile expansion.

Over 12 months, I architected **Root Design System**, transforming fragmented assets into a scalable foundation that enabled cross-platform development and enterprise accessibility compliance.

## The Problem

### Scaling Chaos

The product looked coherent on the surface, but underneath was a "Wild West" preventing scale. As we prepared to launch mobile POS in 2024, the fragmented codebase made every feature exponentially expensive.

    { icon: "shapes", title: "Visual Fragmentation", description: "Inconsistent patterns eroded user trust. <strong>20+ undocumented grey styles</strong> drifted across surfaces." },
    { icon: "file-stack", title: "Zero Source of Truth", description: "No single reference existed. <strong>100+ detached patterns</strong> caused ~60% of effort rebuilding existing UI." },

## The Approach

### From Audit to Architecture

We moved from reactive design to a strategic roadmap:

<ProcessOverview
  title="High-level Process"
  phases={[
    { title: "Phase 1: Discovery", items: ["Visual Debt Audit", "Compliance Assessment", "Stakeholder Alignment"] },
    { title: "Phase 2: Foundation", items: ["Token Architecture", "Core Components", "Documentation Portal"] },
    { title: "Phase 3: Scale", items: ["Pattern Library", "Contribution Model", "Mobile Parity"] }
  ]}
  bottomLabel="Continuous adoption tracking throughout all phases"
/>

**Why this sequence?** Mobile POS was blocked by accessibility gaps. By front-loading compliance into the token foundation, we unlocked both immediate cleanup AND the strategic platform expansion.

## Key Decisions

### Trade-off: Depth vs. Breadth

We chose to build **deep governance infrastructure** rather than a broad component library. Root wasn't just components—it was a shared ownership model.

**Rationale:** Treez teams had tried component libraries before. They failed because Design and Engineering spoke different languages. We needed to fix the handoff, not just the assets.

## Reflection

### Shared Ownership Over Individual Craft

Root wasn't just a project—it was a shift in how Treez teams build, collaborate, and scale. We moved from individual craftsmanship to shared ownership. From design chaos to clarity.

**What I'd do differently:** Start accessibility linting in CI/CD earlier. By month 8, the system was catching issues that could have been automated from day one.

**Key learning:** Design Systems fail when they're "designed for" engineering. Root succeeded because it was "designed with" engineering—the portal and contribution model were co-created from sprint one.
