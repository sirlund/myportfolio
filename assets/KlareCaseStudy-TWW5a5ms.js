Life insurance purchasing in Chile was a lengthy, paper-heavy process taking weeks to complete, creating friction and abandonment in a market that needed modernization and accessibility.`},sections:[{title:"The Challenge",content:`Life insurance purchasing in Chile was a lengthy, paper-heavy process taking weeks to complete, creating friction and abandonment in a market that needed modernization and accessibility. Traditional insurers had no incentive to innovate.

The traditional process involved initial consultation meetings, physical paperwork completion, medical examinations scheduling, document verification by mail, multiple follow-up calls, manual underwriting review, and policy printing and delivery â€” all taking 3-4 weeks.`},{title:"Design Leadership Journey",content:`As UI Lead and later Team Lead, I designed and implemented a completely digital insurance experience that streamlined the entire process into an intuitive, user-friendly journey available in under 10 minutes.

UI Lead Phase (Months 1-8): Started by focusing on creating an intuitive and approachable interface for life insurance. The challenge was making a traditionally complex and intimidating process feel simple and trustworthy.

Team Lead Phase (Months 9-14): Promoted to Team Lead, where I expanded my role to include strategic design decisions, team management, and cross-functional collaboration. Led the design team through rapid scaling and product expansion while maintaining design quality and user focus.`},{title:"UX Innovation Highlights",content:`Trust-Building Design: Insurance requires high levels of trust. I designed trust signals throughout the experience including progress indicators, security badges, transparent pricing, and clear policy explanations.

Intelligent Form Design: Created smart forms that adapt based on user responses, showing only relevant questions and providing contextual help. Used progressive disclosure to break complex insurance concepts into digestible steps.

Educational Integration: Integrated educational content throughout the process to help users understand life insurance concepts without overwhelming them. Created interactive calculators and scenario builders.

Mobile-First Approach: Designed primarily for mobile devices, recognizing that most Chilean users would access insurance services through their phones. The entire application process was optimized for thumb navigation and small screen interactions.`},{title:"Results & Impact",content:`Reduced application completion time from weeks to under 10 minutes, achieved 85% completion rate on the digital flow, and established Klare as a leading insurtech innovator in the Chilean market.

Klare became a case study for digital transformation in the insurance industry across Latin America. Our approach influenced other insurtech startups and forced traditional insurers to modernize their processes to remain competitive. The design patterns and user experience innovations we created became industry standards for digital insurance in Chile.`}]})}export{t as KlareCaseStudy,t as default};
