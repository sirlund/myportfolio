Progressive Complexity: Implemented a progressive disclosure system where interfaces start simple and reveal complexity based on user needs and confidence levels.

Cultural Sensitivity: Incorporated Mexican cultural elements and language patterns while maintaining modern usability standards. Color choices, imagery, and interaction patterns were tested across different demographic groups.

Accessibility by Default: Built accessibility into every component from the ground up, including high contrast ratios, large touch targets, and screen reader optimization.`},{title:"Implementation Strategy",content:`Developed a comprehensive design system that balanced modern digital standards with cultural sensitivity, creating accessible interfaces that served both tech-savvy urban users and traditional customers new to digital services.

Integrated the new design system with legacy financial systems while maintaining security and compliance requirements. Created abstraction layers that allowed modern interfaces to communicate with older backend systems without compromising user experience.`},{title:"Results & Impact",content:`Increased digital adoption by 65% among traditional customers and streamlined the design process across 15+ digital touchpoints, supporting the institution's digital transformation goals while maintaining their reputation for trustworthiness.

The design system successfully bridged the gap between tradition and innovation, enabling Nacional Monte de Piedad to serve their diverse customer base more effectively.
