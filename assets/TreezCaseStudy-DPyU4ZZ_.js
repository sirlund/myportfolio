By late 2023, the company had grown rapidly, and its web platform had accumulated years of visual debt and inconsistent design practices. The mobile POS app was in early design planning for 2024, but the web experience was already used daily by hundreds of dispensary employees and admins.

At that time:
‚Ä¢ Teams were working in silos
‚Ä¢ Figma files were bloated with duplicates
‚Ä¢ Design-to-dev handoffs were inconsistent
‚Ä¢ Accessibility was mostly unaccounted for
‚Ä¢ There was no shared design language
